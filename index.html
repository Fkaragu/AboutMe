      <p>My name is <strong>Francis Thande Karagu</strong> of XX years. Am the
      second born in a family of three boys and am the second born. I have been
      given a task as part of my first independent project at school to create a
      website that provides more information <br>regarding who i am and what i can
      do in terms of the experience <br>i gained this week (1) at <em>Moringa prep.
      </em> <span class="love">Just to let you in on a little <br>secret am loving
      coding and wondering why i didn't start this course<br>earlier than this
      week but all in all its fine.</span></p>
