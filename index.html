      <p>My name is Francis Thande Karagu of XX years. Am the second born <br>
      in a family of three boys and am the second born. I have been given a <br>
      task as part of my first independent project at school to create a<br>
      website that provides more information regarding who i am and what i <br>
      can do in terms of the experience i gained this week(1) at Moringa prep.<br>
      Just to let you in on a little secret am loving coding and wondering <br>
      why i didn't start this course earlier than this week but all in all <br>
      its fine.<br>
