      second born in a family of three boys and am the second born. I have<br>
      been given a task as part of my first independent project at school to<br>
      create a website that provides more information regarding who i am<br>
      and what i can do in terms of the experience i gained this week (1) at<br>
      <em>Moringa prep.</em> <span class="love">Just to let you in on a little secret am loving<br>
      coding and wondering why i didn't start this course earlier than this<br>
      week but all in all its fine.</span></p>
